## 📊 Key Insights

- **High-risk decades:** 1940s–1970s experienced the highest number of fatal accidents due to war, older aircraft models, and limited safety measures.  
- **Top countries by accidents:** USA, Russia, and Brazil recorded the highest number of fatal accidents globally.  
- **Aircraft & operators:** Douglas C-47 aircraft and military operators accounted for a significant share of historical incidents.  
- **Safety progress:** Since the 1990s, fatal accidents and fatalities have dropped sharply, reflecting advancements in aircraft engineering and stricter safety protocols.  
- **Overall impact:** Despite over 9,000 fatal accidents and 128,000 fatalities, the fatality rate per accident has decreased drastically in recent decades.
