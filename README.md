# Global Aviation Accident Analysis

**From Chaos to Control: How Data Tells the Story of Aviation Safety**

From chaos to control, aviation safety has evolved through decades of lessons written in data. This project, Global Aviation Accident Analysis, explores historical aviation accident records to uncover patterns behind fatal accidents, operator performance, geographic trends, and long‑term safety improvements.

Using data analytics and visualization, the project transforms raw accident records into insights that help answer one key question:

How has global aviation safety changed over time, and what factors have contributed to improvements or risks?


Objectives

-The main goals of this analysis were to:

-Examine historical trends in aviation accidents and fatalities

-Identify periods of high risk and major improvements in safety

-Analyze accident distribution across regions and operators

-Understand the relationship between accident frequency and fatal outcomes

-Communicate findings clearly through an interactive Power BI dashboard

## 📊 Key Insights

- **High-risk decades:** 1940s–1970s experienced the highest number of fatal accidents due to war, older aircraft models, and limited safety measures.  
- **Top countries by accidents:** USA, Russia, and Brazil recorded the highest number of fatal accidents globally.  
- **Aircraft & operators:** Douglas C-47 aircraft and military operators accounted for a significant share of historical incidents.  
- **Safety progress:** Since the 1990s, fatal accidents and fatalities have dropped sharply, reflecting advancements in aircraft engineering and stricter safety protocols.  
- **Overall impact:** Despite over 9,000 fatal accidents and 128,000 fatalities, the fatality rate per accident has decreased drastically in recent decades.
  
- Despite recording over 9,000 fatal accidents historically, global aviation safety has improved dramatically.
  
-Fatality rates have decreased even as air travel volume increased.

-Safety improvements are not accidental — they are the result of data‑driven regulation, engineering, and accountability.
